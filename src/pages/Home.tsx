                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I’m Mithun Makam, a Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
                    student at Boston University pursuing a minor in Computer
                    Science. I’m interested in how understanding disease at the
                    molecular level can lead to better ways to detect and treat
                    it. My interests include cancer biology, molecular diagnostics,
                    and the growing role of computational tools in biological research.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Studying computer science alongside biology has encouraged
                    me to think about scientific problems from different
                    perspectives. I enjoy the precision and logic of programming,
                    as well as the curiosity and creativity involved in
                    experimental research. I hope to bring these skills together
                    as I continue exploring biotechnology and translational science.
                </p>

                <h2>Beyond the Classroom</h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching and connecting with others are also important parts
                    of my college experience. As a peer tutor, I help students
                    work through challenging concepts in organic chemistry and
                    physics. Tutoring has taught me to adapt my explanations,
                    listen carefully, and help others build confidence in their
                    own problem-solving abilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a CAS Dean’s Host, I also have the opportunity to share
                    my experience at Boston University with prospective students
                    and their families. Outside academics, I enjoy weightlifting
                    and playing soccer. These activities give me time to recharge,
                    challenge myself, and connect with people beyond the classroom
                    and laboratory.
                </p>

                <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                <p>
                    After graduation, I hope to work in research to strengthen
                    my experimental skills and explore the scientific questions
                    I would like to pursue in graduate school. I’m particularly
                    drawn to work that connects an understanding of disease
                    mechanisms with practical advances in diagnostics and treatment.
                </p>
